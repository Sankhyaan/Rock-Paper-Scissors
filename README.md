This project is a Rock Paper Scissors game built with React. It is designed to let a player compete against a computer with the classic choices: rock, paper, or scissors. The game is for 5 points. Whoever reaches it first wins the game. This application offers an interactive, fun way to play the Rock Paper Scissors game in a web browser.


You pick rock, paper, or scissors by clicking that respective button shown in the web app. Then the computer makes its pick. The game compares both choices and tells you who won the round: you, the computer, or if it's a tie. You keep playing rounds and the game keeps track of the score. Once either you or the computer wins 5 rounds, the game ends and shows who won overall. You can then start a new game if you want.


It's an easy and fun way to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer anytime just by opening it in the web browser, and the computer picks randomly in each round, just like a real opponent would.
